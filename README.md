In this project we are going to host a wordpress website on AWS . It is going to be a beinner friendly project which can help you to understand few AWS features . 
Major Concepts which are going to cover -
1-VPC
2-EC2
3-S3
4-RDS

We will be starting with creation of a VPC and to create VPC check the region first as there will be multiple factors involved . Once we create VPC we will require two subnets one public subnet and second a private subnet . Our Public subnet will host our application on EC2 and our private Subnet will be having database . After this process we need to link our web application which is hosted on EC2 with our database(RDS) then we will install Wordpress website
